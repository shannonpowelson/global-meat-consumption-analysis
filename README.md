# Global Meat Consumption Analysis
## Background
For this analysis, global meat consumption is analyzed.  There has been a growing debate around red meat and its impacts on health.  According to one [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200203114328.htm) conducted by Northwestern University, higher red meat consumption was linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease and death.  However, a previous source claimed that red meat does not impact cardiovascular disease risk.  Therefore, for this analysis, we explore global trends to see if countries with higher beef consumption have higher cardiovascular disease death rates.  Furthermore, there recently has been a great deal of interest in the [Mediterranean diet](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801) which is a plant based diet with very little red meat.  This diet is supposed to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease.  Therefore, we also investigate the trends over time to see if countries are consuming less red meat and becoming more in line with the Mediterranean diet.
