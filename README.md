# Global Meat Consumption Analysis
## Background
For this analysis, global meat consumption is analyzed.  There has been a growing debate around red meat and its impacts on health.  According to one [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200203114328.htm) conducted by Northwestern University, higher red meat consumption was linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease and death.  However, a previous source claimed that red meat does not impact cardiovascular disease risk.  Therefore, for this analysis, we explore global trends to see if countries with higher beef consumption have higher cardiovascular disease death rates.  Furthermore, there recently has been a great deal of interest in the [Mediterranean diet](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801) which is a plant based diet with very little red meat.  This diet is supposed to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease.  Therefore, we also investigate the trends over time to see if countries are consuming less red meat and becoming more in line with the Mediterranean diet.  

## Business Question

## Data Questions
_Is beef consumption 

## Data Sources

## Data Analysis
To answer our question, we first investigate beef consumption from 1991 to 2026 (predicted values)in kilograms per capita.  We focus on six countries for this analysis: three traditionally [high meat consumption countries](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-meat-consuming-countries-in-the-world.html) (Australia, United States, and Israel) and three traditionally [low meat consumption countries](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-who-consume-the-least-meat.html#:~:text=The%20least%20meat%20consuming%20countries,consuming%20country%20in%20the%20world.) (India, Bangladesh, and Mozambique). 

This graph shows the beef consumption over time for all six countries.

In order to get a better idea of the trends, we graph the beef consumption over time for the three high meat consumption countries.

We also graph the beef consumption over time for the three low meat consumption countries.

We want to explore also explore the cardiovascular death rates.  Therefore, we graph the amount of deaths from cardiovascular disease over time per 100,000 people. We focused on the same six countries for comparison purposes.  



In order to get a better idea of the trends, we graph the cardiovascular disease deaths over time for the three high meat consumption countries.  

We also graph the cardiovascular disease deaths over time for the three low meat consumption countries.  


Finally, to put the beef consumption trends into context, we graph poultry, sheep, pig, and beef consumption over time for one high meat consumption country (The United States) and one low meat consumption country (India).  

Here is the graph for the poultry, sheep, pig, and beef consumption over time in the United States.  

Here is the graph for the poultry, sheep, pig, and beef consumption over time in India.
